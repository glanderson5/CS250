Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Interpreting the users needs in relation to a program begins with understanding what exactly those needs are and why they are   important to the user. A simple list of desired features is fine for understanding what the needs and requirements of the user are, but "user stories" are a much more effective way of accomplishing the second part of that task, understanding WHY those needs are important to the user. User stories help keep development user-centric and maximize the value of the end product. 
  
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I think the most important skill to have in prograaming is the ability to envision large, complex tasks broken down into smaller, simpler, more manageable ones. A key way that I hope to incorporate Agile principles in the future is the process of prioritizing those smaller sub-tasks, ideally based on feedback from others if it's available. This is an element that has not really been present in my CS education thus far. All of my projects and assignments have been graded based purely on whether or not the program succesfully achieves some desired function. The prospect of working with others to create a product that is not just functional but has maximized it's value to the end user is exciting. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Many Agile principles center around the goal of elevating the level of communication and collaboration within a team. A good team member is open to this mentality and is willing to put effort into supporting their team members and contributing to a positive team environment. Agile also strives to constantly improve through interation based on feedback, so a good team member has to be open to receive productive feedback and incorporating it into future iterations.
